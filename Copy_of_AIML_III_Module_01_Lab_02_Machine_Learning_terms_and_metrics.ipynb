There are 20640 samples, each with 8 attributes like income of the block, age of the houses per district etc. The task is to predict the cost of the houses per district. We will use the scikit-learn library to load the data and perform some basic data preprocessing and model training. We will also show how to evaluate the model using some common metrics, split the data into training and testing sets, and use cross-validation to get a better estimate of the model's performance."

        "2. Does it give more accurate estimate of test accuracy? *Yes, it gives more accurate estimate (Validation accuracy using nearest neighbour algorithm without averaging : 0.8627773212818405 %, Average validation accuracy for 50 iterations: 0.8850896157942325 %)*\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the effect of the number of iterations on the estimate? Do we get a better estimate with higher iterations? *As observed with 25 iterations over 10 iterations calculated above we see that the average accuracy has decreased a little bit but with 50 iterations it has increased sufficiently. So substantially high number of iterations might give a better estimate*\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Consider the results you got for the previous questions. Can we deal with a very small train dataset or validation dataset by increasing the iterations? *The validation accuracy has substantially increased from 0.0% to .747% and .621 % for 25 and 50 iterations respectively.*\n"
